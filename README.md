A bunch of really handy iOS libraries I have come across. Dont forget to look [here](https://github.com/cjwirth/awesome-ios-ui) first

##UITableView
* For when you have a simple tableView with a bunch of editable fields. `RETableViewManagerhttps` seems to provide a nice solution //github.com/romaonthego/RETableViewManager

##UIScrollView
* https://github.com/smnh/SMScrollView is a scrollview that manages zooming on a single image quite nicely
* https://github.com/dzenbot/DZNEmptyDataSet Makes sure that if your scrollview has not content that there is always a backup placeholder view

##Alerts
* A UIAlertView alternative that slides down from the top of the app to display a message https://github.com/cwRichardKim/RKDropdownAlert
* https://github.com/cwRichardKim/RKNotificationHub allows for a notification badge to be added to any UIView
* https://github.com/sberrevoets/SDCAlertView is an alert view with a content view

##Cool Animatable Views
* Nothing like a cool, jelly view https://github.com/inFullMobile/WobbleView?utm_campaign=iOS_Dev_Weekly_Issue_193&utm_medium=email&utm_source=iOS%2BDev%2BWeekly allows you to have a wobbling view similar to Skype, think jelly
* https://github.com/Yalantis/Preloader.Ophiuchus offers some great looking animations to labels. Very futuristic, some make it look like paint filling up a label
* https://github.com/lexrus/LTMorphingLabel/blob/master/LTMorphingLabel/LTMorphingLabel.swift has some incredible effects on UILabel text changing
* When toggling a UISwitch you can paint the superview with a funky effect https://github.com/Ramotion/paper-switch
* https://github.com/zipme/RQShineLabel Is a library that animates text by making letters fade in and out like the secret app
* https://github.com/soffes/SAMGradientView/commit/eec861a80486b5dad5a3fc20e68a1b7de8956a1e - Something about being a nice wrapper around gradients 
* https://github.com/jverdi/JVFloatLabeledTextField allows your textfields to always have placeholder text
* https://github.com/PavelKatunin/DownloadButton very similar to the iOS App Store download button. Love buttons that animate their state 

##UICollectionView
* https://github.com/terminatorover/RGCardViewLayout/blob/master/RGCardViewLayout.m is a collection view layout that uses a cool, 3D tinder like effect for swiping cells where they look like cards. Also done in the National Geographic App
* https://github.com/njdehoog/NHBalancedFlowLayout mimics the iOS landscape photo gallery effect where each element has a dynamic size

##Build Tools
* https://fastlane.tools is an automated tool for pretty much everything from making screenshots to submitting to iTunes Connect

##Utilities
* https://github.com/emaloney/CleanroomLogger is a clean logging framework for Swift similar to cocoa lumberjack
* For a lovely color palette check out https://github.com/ViccAlexander/Chameleon
